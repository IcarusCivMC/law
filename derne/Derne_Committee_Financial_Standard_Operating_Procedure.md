# Derne Committee Financial Standard Operating Procedure

**Section 1. Purpose**

To establish a streamlined, decentralized funding model that leverages the Discord Integration of Monument Bank while maintaining strict accountability for city assets commingled with personal funds.

**Section 2. Fund Disbursement**

- **Allocation Method:** All committee funds shall be transferred directly to the Committee Leader's personal Monument Bank account by the Council.

**Section 3. Asset Custody & Commingling**

- Upon receipt of City Funds, the Committee Leader assumes a responsibility that while funds reside in their personal account, the Leader acknowledges that specific portion of their total balance belongs to the committee.

- Committee Funds may only be spent to further the objectives of the committee. The council may deem a transaction illegitimate. In this event, the Committee Leader takes responsibility for the refunding of the illegitimate transfer.

- Every Committee Leader must report the following after each Committee transaction:
   - **Inflow:** Amount received, reason, updated net committee balance
   - **Outflow:** Amount spent, reason, updated net committee balance
   - By definition, __Net Committee Balance__ is the current amount of diamonds in the Leader's personal account that belongs to the committee.

Example:
> **<Committee Name>**
> **Net Update:** -20d
> **Reason:** City Plaza Build
> **Current Balance:** 80d

**Section 4. Continuity Protocol**
1. If a Committee Leader resigns or is terminated from their position by the Council, they are mandated to transfer the remaining committee funds back to the city bank account.

- Refusal to return funds is theft from the city and will be punished accordingly.
