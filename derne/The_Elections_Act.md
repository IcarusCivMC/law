# **DL 1- The Elections Act**

## *Penned by John.*

## **Preamble**

	In accordance with Icarian and Icenian law, this bill is meant to enshrine and describe the election process for the Dernish Government.

## 

## **Section 1 \- Election Process**

**To quote the Dernish Charter Addenda 1-**  
Chair elections are held for three seats, in a Single Transferable Vote. After the Chairs are elected, the chairs themselves appoint the Mayor of Derne, from the Council of Chairs. In the event of a tie, it is broken by runoff voting. Elections are to be held once per month, starting from the day of ratification of the Charters.

**Furthermore-**  
Election periodicity as described above is one month, but in practice, it is easier to establish a familiar cycle within the week. As such, to avoid election periods that are shorter or longer, the election cycle month will be defined as 6 weeks, scheduled so that a new government is always announced on the Tuesday following proceedings.
