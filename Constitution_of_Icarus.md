We, the Citizens of Icarus, united under the protection of superior laws above, do hereby

liberties of all Icarian citizens. Through this charter, we affirm our commitment to democracy,
accountability, and community, and ordain this Constitution as the supreme law of the State of Icarus.

The flag of the Republic shall be three units wide and two units tall. It shall be divided into three
vertical stripes of equal width and height. The colors of the stripes shall be, from left to right,
black, white and red.
### Section 3
This constitution recognises the status of the Second Republic of Icarus as a state of Icenia and
thus in turn recognises the supremacy of the Icenian constitution.

approval of the governor. If the clause is triggered every citizen will vote on whether to leave or
stay in Icenia.
### Section 5

the Parliament and decrees passed by the Governor shall be considered void in the case that they

## Article II - Government Hierarchy

All government officials in the Republic must hold Icenian Citizenship. This does not apply to
the governance of each local jurisdiction. Each member of the government must maintain
activity in accordance with Article VIII or else be removed from office via a petition reaching ⅔

supervision immediately in accordance with Article VIII.
### Section 2

### Section 3
The Parliament of Icarus shall be the principal governing body of the Republic and legislative
power. The Parliament is to be elected on a monthly basis, with their numbers determined by the

proposals. When a conflict arises or a policy that affects two cities locally is to be drafted, a
