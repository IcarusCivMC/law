# Advisors Act

The parliament may, via a simple majority vote, appoint advisors to assist in discussions and decision making. These advisors serve until the dissolution of the parliament unless they are removed via simple majority vote. They shall have access to all government channels but not be able to vote.

A member of parliament has to nominate a citizen to initiate the vote. A member who's earlier nominee is currently serving as advisor may not nominate another until their previous nominee resigns
